# Apache Unomi

Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee. 
It provides a high-performance user profile and event tracking server.

The server is a data management platform that provides real-time user profile and event storage as well as a rule engine and fully featured REST+JSON 
interfaces which make integration with very different systems easier.

One of the main objectives of this implementation is to be modular and flexible enough to relatively easily build integration into systems such as CMS, 
WCM, CRM or even ERP. Built using Apache Karaf and ElasticSearch, it is designed to also be easily clusterable to address high-traffic scenarios where lots of profile data will need to be updated at a high frequency.
